# OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:
The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm which applies an Finite Element Analysis in 2D using 2D Quad Elements

# DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONS:

-   MainFE_Notebook.ipynb: The main script that shows results.
-   ShapeFunction.py: Defines the shape function for 2D Quad Element. See Notes.pdf file for detailed explanation.
-   Jacobian.py: Calculates the Jacobian. 
-   GaussQuadrature: Defines the integration points.
